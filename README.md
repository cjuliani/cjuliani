I'm an ML engineer from France with experiences in MLOps, computer vision, NLP and web application development.

## üìïProjects

* ### [Recommendation System with Variational Autoencoder (VAE) - TensorFlow 2, MLflow](https://github.com/cjuliani/recommendation-system-vae-mlflow)
A VAE-based Recommender System designed to provide personalized recommendations for users based on their historical interactions with items (collaborative filtering). The recommender is tested against the user-item interactions from the Movies Lens 20M dataset. Training models are versioned by MLflow.
  
* ### [Perfume Reviews Analysis - NLP, Dash App](https://github.com/cjuliani/perfume-reviews-nlp-dash-app)
Example of Dash application developed for the analysis of 20k+ multi-language product reviews (sentiment analysis, word frequency and semantic similarity). NLP tools include Spacy, NLTK, TextBlob and Marian transformers (machine translation). 

* ### [Deep learning app deployment (module frontend + backend)](https://github.com/cjuliani/deep-learning-app-flask-jquery-celery-socketio-docker)
Simple module of a web application with deep learning (vision system) as a service: asynchronous processing of long tasks and continuous streaming of information to client side. Backend server setup and fromt-end development. Tools: Flask, Flask-SocketIO, Celery, jQuery, AJAX, SocketIO.

* ### [Mask RCNN written in Tensorflow 2 (+ integration testing)](https://github.com/cjuliani/Mask-RCNN-Tensorflow-2)
A custom-built mask-rcnn model written with TensorFlow 2, and associated integration testing module written with PyUnit.

* ### [Transaction fraud detection (Pandas + multiprocessing)](https://github.com/cjuliani/transaction-fraud-detection)
A data science project to predict whether a transaction is a fraud or not. Processing of 200,000+ transaction records, feature engineering and data analysis. Learning models are trainer and tested (Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbour, multi-layer perceptrons).

* ### [3D detection in point cloud data via Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)](https://github.com/cjuliani/3D-object-detection-via-Graph-Convolutional-Networks)
The algorithm addresses the 3D object detection task from point cloud sonar data to capture specified terrain information with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and a deep voting module.

* ### [Object-based Probabilistic Similarity Evidence (OPSE) of Latent Features from FCNs](https://github.com/cjuliani/probabilistic-similarity-evidence-FCN)
OPSE is an algorithm processing the latent characteristics of fully convolutional networks (FCNs) to group objects with analogous properties. Its application is demonstrated using the UT Zappos50K datasets.

* ### [Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN)](https://github.com/cjuliani/Wasserstein-Generative-Adversarial-Network-TensorFlow-2)
A simple implementation of WGAN written with TensorFlow 2.
